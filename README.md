# Social Network API

## Description: In this application, a user such as an owner of a social media startup has a back end access to view, update, or delete data from a NoSQL database for a social media network website.

## After starting the application in terminal, the user can interface with the data through routes in Insomnia. The user can either view all social media users, all thoughts posted by the users, all reactions a thought post has, or the number of friends each user has. Users and thoughts can be deleted, updated, or added through insomnia, as well as reactions to thoughts and friends can be added or removed from users. Also, as a bonus, when a user is deleted, the user's associated data (thoughts, reactions, and friends) are also deleted.
---
### This application is initialized using command-line application, and access the employee database using NoSQL. The resulting data are displayed using Insomnia Core.
